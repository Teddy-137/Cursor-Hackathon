description: How I like to code globs: alwaysApply: false

- Focus on the area of code relevant to the task
- Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task
- Write thorough tests for all major functionality, using Django Rest Framework's testing tools (e.g., APITestCase) for API endpoints
- Avoid making major changes to patterns and architectures of how features work, after they have shown to work well, unless explicitly instructed to do so
- Always think about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes
